Java with spring boot

Initilaised springboot with dependecncies : 

	Spring Web → REST endpoints
	Spring Data JPA → ORM for PostgreSQL
	PostgreSQL Driver → Connect to Postgres
	Spring Security → JWT auth for admin APIs
	Spring Boot DevTools → hot reload for dev
	Lombok → reduces boilerplate for entities/controllers
 
	Spring Data Redis → for threshold rules & counters
	Validation → @Valid annotations for request payloads
	Spring Boot Actuator → health endpoints, metrics

Configured application.yml including:

	database
	jpa
	redis config
	jwt security


Using docker:

	installed docker
	setup postgres for docker
		docker run --name security-postgres \ -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ENTERNAME \ -e POSTGRES_DB=ENTERDB \ -p 5432:5432 \ -d postgres:15

	setup redis
		docker run --name security-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis:7
	test: docker exec -it security-redis redis-cli ping

	Add docker compose to project root to persist data, stop and run container



1 — High-level goal

	A backend service that accepts security events (failed logins, privilege escalations, anomalous activity),
 	stores them, runs detection rules, and raises alerts (email/webhook/console). It should support configurable rules, audit trails,
  	and an analyst interface (API) to triage alerts.



2 — Core components

	Ingest API (Spring Boot REST) — receive events from apps/agents.

	Event Store — persistent storage for raw events & metadata (Postgres / Elasticsearch).

	Rule Engine — evaluates events against rules (thresholds, anomaly detectors).

	Alert Service — creates alerts, deduplicates, escalates (email/webhook).

	Analytics / Reporting — aggregation endpoints (failed logins per user/IP).

	Admin API / UI — manage rules, view alerts, mark triage status.

	Worker Queue — processes events/rules asynchronously (Kafka/RabbitMQ or Spring TaskExecutor).

	Cache — Redis for counts / temporary state (sliding windows, rate limits).



3 — Tech stack

	Language/Framework: Java 17 + Spring Boot

	Persistence: PostgreSQL for relational data, optionally Elasticsearch for log search/analytics

	Queue: RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka (Kafka if high throughput)

	Cache: Redis (sliding windows, rate counters)

	Auth: JWT + role-based access for admin APIs

	Docs: OpenAPI/Swagger

	CI/CD: GitHub Actions (build, test, docker image)

	Deployment: Docker + ECS / EKS / Heroku / GCP Cloud Run

	Optional: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics



4 — Example REST endpoints

	Authentication assumed via JWT.

	Authentication/Admin:

		POST /auth/login — returns JWT

		GET /users — admin list users

	Event ingestion (public/internal tokens):

		POST /events — ingest one or batch of events (accepts json array)

		body: { "source":"webapp","events":[{ "type":"LOGIN_FAIL","user":"alice","ip":"1.2.3.4","timestamp":"..." , "details":{...}}] }

	Alerts & triage:

		GET /alerts — list alerts with filters (status, severity, time range)

		GET /alerts/{id} — alert details (events attached)

		POST /alerts/{id}/comment — analyst comment

		POST /alerts/{id}/close — close/resolve alert

	Rules:

		GET /rules — list

		POST /rules — create (json config)

		PUT /rules/{id} — update/enable/disable

	Reporting:

		GET /reports/failed-logins?from=...&to=...&groupBy=ip,user

		GET /reports/top-suspicious-ips?limit=50



6 — Detection rule examples
	
 	A. Simple threshold rule
	
		Rule config (JSON):
		
		{
		"type": "RATE",
		"description": "Lockout after 5 failed logins in 10 minutes",
		"window_seconds": 600,
		"threshold": 5,
		"group_by": ["user","ip"],
		"action": "CREATE_ALERT"
		}
		
		
		Implementation outline:
		
		On each LOGIN_FAIL event, increment counter in Redis key fail:{group} with TTL 600s.
		
		If counter > threshold → emit alert (include recent event ids).
	
	B. Geo anomaly (impossible travel)
	
		Idea: detect two successful logins for same user from geographically distant IPs within a small time window.
		
		Use GeoIP to map IP → lat/lon.
		
		For each LOGIN_SUCCESS, check last success for user: compute distance and time delta.
  		If distance/time implies travel > plausible speed (e.g., > 500 km/h), flag as anomaly.
	
	C. Unusual privilege change
	
		If an account receives a role elevation (USER → ADMIN) and dev or service account performed it, create HIGH severity alert 
  		and require manual review.
	
	D. Behavioral baseline (advanced)
	
		Build per-user baseline of typical API call volumes or endpoints accessed (rolling window average). 
  		Use z-score: z = (current_count - mean)/std. If z > 3, alert.
		
		Could implement with simple statistical windowing initially; later swap to ML.



7 — Alerting & deduplication

	Deduplication strategy: alerts tied to a rule + group (e.g., rule "5 fails" + user=alice). If identical alert exists OPEN, 
 	increment a counter and append events instead of creating a new alert.
	
	Escalation: if an alert remains OPEN for > X minutes and severity >= HIGH, send SMS/email to on-call.
	
	Delivery: SMTP for email, webhooks for integrations (Slack, PagerDuty).



8 — Storage & querying choices

	Postgres works for relational storage and moderate query loads; use jsonb for flexible event details and indexing (GIN).
	
	If you want powerful search and aggregation (text search over logs), add Elasticsearch to index events; 
 	use it for GET /events/search.
	
	Use Redis for ephemeral counters/sliding window algorithms.



9 — Scaling & resilience

	Use asynchronous ingestion: POST /events writes to queue; workers consume and process rules. 
 	This decouples spikes.
	
	Partition events by time (DB partitioning) for long-term retention.
	
	Add backpressure and rate-limiting on ingestion endpoint.
	
	Implement retention policies: raw events older than X months archived to S3 or removed.



10 — Security considerations (you must be able to discuss these)

	Secure ingestion: require API keys + TLS. Authenticate agents.
	
	Input validation & deny-listing for event payloads to avoid injection.
	
	Protect stored sensitive data: if events include PII, encrypt details column at rest 
 	(Transparent DB encryption or application-level encryption).
	
	RBAC: only certain roles can view sensitive fields or create rules.
	
	Audit all admin actions in audit_log.
	
	Secrets management: use environment variables or a secret manager; do not commit keys.



11 — Testing strategy

	Unit tests for rule logic (JUnit + Mockito). Example: simulate N failed logins and assert alert created.
	
	Integration tests: start Spring context + embedded DB, simulate ingestion → rule evaluation → alert.
	
	E2E tests: dry-run with a small dataset and assert reports endpoints produce expected aggregates.



12 — Observability & metrics

	Expose Prometheus metrics: events_ingested_total, alerts_created_total, rule_eval_latency_seconds.
	
	Log structured messages (JSON) for pipeline debugging.
	
	Add health endpoints and readiness/liveness probes.



13 — Minimal viable implementation (MVP) — what to build first

	Spring Boot app with JWT auth and a simple admin user.
	
	POST /events to store events in Postgres.
	
	One rule (failed logins threshold) implemented synchronously (no queue) using Redis counters.
	
	GET /alerts to view alerts.
	
	Basic unit/integration tests and Dockerfile.
